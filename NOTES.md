+ Supposed to be good
+ Uses pure functions
+ Lightweight
+ Scalability
+ Information Flow - bi-directional...
  + Data flows down...
  + Actions flow up...
  + Compartmentalizing diffrent behaviors
+ Takes in a state - returns a whole new state
  + pure functions
  + returns copies of state
  + keep track of previous states
+ Immutability
  + We want to be very careful about how we change our state
+ Keeping track of our application state in our object
+ Store ????
+ Dispatcher ???
+ Actions ????
+ Reducers ???

+ How does the dispatcher fit into the design of Redux?

CHALLENGE:

+ Add the functionality so that when a user clicks the 'Subtract' button, our state decrements and the view re-renders.
+ Add a button that says "RESET" - this should set the state back to zero and again re-render.
